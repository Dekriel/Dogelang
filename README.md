# Dogelang
welcome to Dogelang, a experimental language developed by me. The code isn't very well optimized, so over the next few weeks you should see better optimization in the code.


# Installation guide
I recommend you *don't* install, because it's (as I said, experimental) and it bugs a lot, and I mean a lot. However, if you're just seeing what this language can do, here are the instructions:


1.) Install python via python.org (latest version recommended)


2.) Add python to PATH (very important)


3.) `cd` to the correct directory (something like `~dogelang/dogelang` where you can see `shell.py` by using `dir` or `ls`)


4.) `python shell.py shell`


5.) have fun....


# Important notes + updates:
I'll try to fix print statements, if statements, while loops, variable decleration etc. It's very messy and I see a heck **ton** of unneeded code.
